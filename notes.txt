Must have .html extension
Must be called index because that's what the browser looks for in the main website

<html> start tag
</html> end tag

<body> is nested within html

In the browser: file:/// -> the computer's file system
Navigate to the index.html file (file:///Users/Olaya/git/olayafg.github.io/index.html)

html doesn't care about whitespace, linebreaks...
    <p> can have returns or tabs inside it and it will
    render as 1 paragraph.
<br/> linebreak

Best place for CSS code is in the <head> of the html,
before the <body>. Also the place for the metadata.

<title> Appears on the tab in the browser, also the name if you bookmark

<style> CSS language
    name the tag to style and curly brackets {}
    argument : (end each with ;)
    margin: 3em (the width of 3 m)

<img src="microscope.jpg"/> (self closing tab at the end)

<a href=""> </a> link
